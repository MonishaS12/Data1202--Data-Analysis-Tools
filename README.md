# Video Game Sales Analysis

Project Description
This project analyzes video game sales data to determine trends before and after 2005. It involves data cleaning, classification, and sales performance comparison using Python.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy

Installing
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/video-game-sales-analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd video-game-sales-analysis

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests
The dataset is checked for missing values.
Missing values in the 'Year' column are replaced with the most common year.
Games are classified into 'pre-2005' and 'post-2005'.
The average global sales for both periods are calculated and compared.
The final output indicates which period had higher sales.

Deployment
To run the project:
jupyter notebook Videogame-Sales.ipynb
Open the notebook and execute the cells to see the analysis.
